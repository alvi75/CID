Cattle livestock trading is scaling with exponential growth and man-aging this scaled production and procurement has become a hugechallenge for the industry. With a vision to solve this challengeswith emerging technologies and state of the art techniques fromcomputer vision we tried to develop a large possible dataset whichis labeled and accurate so that our research community can buildtheir novel models or finetune existing ones without the hassle ofdata collection. We developed our cow image dataset of 17,899 cattlelivestock(cow) images with vitals(sex, color, breed, feed, age, teeth,height, weight, price, size) which can be used for both classificationand regression. We are also contributing a baseline model of multiinput-output network which can be used to classify and regresscattle livestock vitals and our baseline model has 1 input - 2 outputswhich has accuracy of 75% and 67% respectively for age and breed.Measuring and estimating cattle livestock vitals is an open researcharea and our dataset and baseline model is going to play a vital rolefor further research opportunity.
