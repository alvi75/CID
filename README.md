# CID: Cow Images dataset for regression and classification
## Abstract
Cattle livestock trading is scaling with exponential growth and managing this scaled production and procurement has become a huge challenge for the industry. With a vision to solve these chal- lenges with emerging technologies and state-of-the-art techniques from computer vision, we tried to develop a large possible dataset that is labeled and accurate so that our research community can build their novel models or finetune existing ones without the has- sle of data collection. We developed our cow images dataset of 17,899 images with vitals(sex, color, breed, feed, age, teeth, height, weight, price, size) which can be used for both classification and regression. We are also contributing a baseline model of multi input- output network(1 input - 2 outputs) to classify and regress cattle livestock vitals which have the accuracy of 75% and 67% respec- tively for age and breed. Estimating or predicting cattle livestock vitals is an open research area and our cow images dataset and baseline model is going to play a vital role towards further re- search opportunity.
